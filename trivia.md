floating point operations aren't assosciative. But they are commutative.
Eg:

1 + \epsilon + \epsilon where \epsilon is a little bigger than \epsilon_{machine}

1. If you add first two terms, you get 1 , and then the final result is 1.
2. If you add the later two terms first, you get something larger than \epsilon_{machine}. Upon adding 1, you get a number greater than 1.
